     <h2>Things I Learned While Travelling</h2>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>After the events of the past couple of years, which may sound ambigious, but sufficly made me take a good loook at my life and ended up with me getting a mortgage, quitting my job and travelling (yes I know some of those are contradictory but meh) I have spent a lot of time this year so far on the road.</p>

<p>It's been amazing - I feel extremely priviledged to be able to wander across the western world. I haven't had the money or time in my life so far and making it my priority this year has been a life time ambition and has helped heal me in a number of ways. However there have been a few unexpected things I've learnt.</p>

<p>It's exhausting - uttely. I'm on my longest trip so far as I write this, 19 days. I forgot to take a break day in the middle somewhere with nothing to do where I could stay in, sleep, go to a spa or something. I've hopped from city to city, jumping on trains, planes, utterly exchausted from walking miles everyday! And people do this for months at a time. I'm just doing it for weeks!</p>

<p>It's super expensive - you think you can travel on the cheap. Even with public transport, picking up cheap food in supermarkets, staying at hostels and airbnbs… it's still expensive. As soon as you leave the house you're spending money. (Also if you're UK based that whole pound is weak thing really <em>does</em> make a difference).</p>

<p>I can travel on one carry on backpack. Yeh sure it's a super nice carry on size special backpack that actually holds 30L (see here, it's a Douchbag if you're asking). I've surprised myself by not needing anything, and I'm going from summer (40deg) to Brazilian winter (15deg) I've got my laptop, very small bottles of a zillion toileteries, a few changes of clothing and am doing laundary when I need to.</p>

<p>It's been extremely useful having one backpack. Having carry on means you will always have your luggage with you. This is important. I've had three cancelled flights this year and if I'd checked in my luggage it wouldn't have been with me by the time I would have gotten where I needed to go. It's with me right here right now and it gives me great piece of mind. When I change flights in Sau Paulo I don't have to waste time collecting baggage. When I flew into JFK instead of Newark on Sunday I didn't have to worry my luggage was somewhere completely different.</p>

<p>You can do an amazing amount in one day. I spent 48 in New York and although I can't wait to go back I feel like I ran around that city. I've seen it.</p>

<p>People are people whereever you go. Be nice and they're nice back.</p>
