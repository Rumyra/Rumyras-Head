    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since I wrote for Geek Mental Health week about my (then) recent experiences with depression. It’s both strange and fitting that it’s a year on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="its-been-one-hell-of-a-year"&gt;It’s been one hell of a year.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-reading the article now it seems such a sensible read. I really felt like I was on the road to recovery in last October, but the road was longer than I expected, and I’m pretty sure there’s still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d had nearly a couple of months off over the summer and was integrated back into work by the time I wrote that article. Looking back now of course that was not enough time, it was rushed. Not just because you start to feel better and so think you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; better, but people around you are urging you to get better as well and that’s because they want you to be better. Unfortunately it’s not that simple. I was still recovering from quite a big shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I can describe the way I was feeling is that all my skin had been worn away by things that had happened, sanded down, and I couldn’t take any more things wearing it away. I needed recovery to build it all back up again and that was going to take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="i-was-better-but-i-wasnt-well"&gt;I was better, but I wasn’t well.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the support of councilling, I had made some decisions about the changes I wanted to make in my life, some of which were driving the unhappiness, some I hoped would help me move on. Buying a house and leaving my job where two of them. House buying happened over new year and it was very stressful, a few other things were going on as well, normal everyday things, physical health issues arose, some personal relationship things. Things that are normally quite capable, but on top of everything else, by the time the house went through, everything had come crashing back down around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February I took yet another month off work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still hadn’t stopped seeing my councillor at this point. This ended up being one of the most beneficial things in terms of my recovery, and there were definitely times I felt it wasn’t right or I didn’t need to see her anymore, but I stuck with it and I am glad. Again I was integrated back into work, but this time I could hand in my notice. This was the biggest drain on my well being and leaving has irrefutably improved my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="slowly-but-surely-i-started-to-see-a-change"&gt;Slowly but surely I started to see a change.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to stand on my own two feet again and move my life out of this bleak emptiness that engulfed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with these things days are still a struggle. And it comes and goes in waves. But I was with my mum the other day, who said I was noticeably different, I didn’t look so withdrawn and colourless. I don’t feel so colourless anymore, I don’t feel like a shell, I feel like there’s something inside me again. I hold on to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year was about being unwell and I stand by my last article, if you feel unwell please seek help, because this year, for me, this year has been about getting better. I hope now I can focus on getting well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, don’t try to rush getting better, I know it’s an easy thing to say. I’ve never wanted my mental health to define me, even before the crash of last year, so I never give myself a break. This isn’t healthy, when you’re sick, you need to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this two days ago when I was stuck in an airport. I'm sure each one of you has frequented an airport recently what with it being the summer holidays and all. In fact you might even be reading this in an airport. It's not a long one, I've been a bit out of touch with the travelling, but there's still some gems 💎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onishiweb"&gt;Adam's&lt;/a&gt; been doing some great writing recently, check out &lt;a href="http://adamonishi.com/"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; if you don't already. &lt;a href="http://adamonishi.com/2016/08/web-components-and-progressive-enhancement/"&gt;This article about Web Components and progressive enhancements&lt;/a&gt; is especially cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something also super helpful for me recently was &lt;a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2016/07/getting-started-webpack/"&gt;this blog post from Daniel Mies&lt;/a&gt; about getting started with webpack. I was postCSS/cssnext-ing and not only was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielmies"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; extremely helpful (super cool person to follow), but so was his post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/"&gt;Generate your own map&lt;/a&gt; using a really well thought out process and well documented. In face check out &lt;a href="http://mewo2.com/"&gt;Martin's homepage&lt;/a&gt; it appears everything he does is a pretty cool link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not audio enough for you yet? I've been checking out and playing around with &lt;a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js"&gt;Tone.js&lt;/a&gt; recently. It's a super nice layer over the Web Audio API. Me and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_2xAA"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; put together a cool thing which I will share after I've stopped demoing it at conferences. (I promise it's super cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not cool enough for you yet?  Check out &lt;a href="http://executabledreams.net/B/emojiwin"&gt;this insane emoji fest&lt;/a&gt; - solitare style graphics on canvas - also supports multi touch events! Yup, I think it's actually too cool. 🎶💥🎉😎💙&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and it's my birthday in a month. Yes, I know you're thinking: 'What the 😳 can I get Ruth? She's already got like 5 MIDI controllers…' Well you can totally &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.me/rumyra"&gt;donate to the Holtzmanns glasses fund&lt;/a&gt;. Yes I super think having a &lt;a href="http://www.liveforfilm.com/2016/08/04/ghostbusters-you-can-buy-holtzmanns-glasses/"&gt;pair of these&lt;/a&gt; from the recent Ghostbusters would be super cool to VJ in 😎-&amp;gt;😆 Hell I'd even wear them when writing these cool links posts, and that would easily make them ten times cooler!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Font Awesome SVGs</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doing a lot of prototyping in the past, having &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/"&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; as part of my front end starter files was always really handy for quickly adding icons when I was building a UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we are more aware that using a font to represent icons isn’t necessarily the most accessible thing to do for everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xXBYcWgCHA"&gt;as Serend explains here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I’m whipping up a website right at this moment I thought it a good opportunity to take the first steps to swap out the font for svgs. So…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="heres-a-repo-with-font-awesome-icons-as-svgshttpsgithubcomrumyrafont-awesome-svgs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Rumyra/Font-Awesome-SVGs"&gt;Here’s a repo with font awesome icons as svgs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forked the Font Awesome repo so I can keep it as up to date with the original as I can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I added an SVG folder to add all the generated glyphs to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-blast"&gt;font blast&lt;/a&gt; to generate SVGs from a font, a la &lt;a href="https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/icon-fonts-to-svg/"&gt;Sara Soueidan mentions in her blog post here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To include the SVG’s I used the CSS Inline SVG Sprites method, &lt;a href="https://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/"&gt;again described by Sara here&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed the easiest to integrate with the set up I already had, as I was using classes to add icons to elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most long winded part was making sure I had all the correct icons - I think a good addition to this repo would be a generated spite sheet with stylesheet companion and easy reference classes. I’ve opened an issue 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———————————————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Font Awesome licensing etc… still applies. Info etc… is in the origin &lt;a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome"&gt;readme here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Phew, isn’t it warm 🌞🔥☀️*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well then, I guess it’s time for another instalment of ‘Rumyra’s Cool Links’ (the time will come when this has it’s own space).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*For those viewing outside the UK it was 35 degrees yesterday and the country melted, we are currently trying to reanimate ourselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily and undoubtably top of my cool links this time is &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/qNrZyw"&gt;Jake Albaugh’s arpeggiator&lt;/a&gt;. I just can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get enough of this. What an inspired, solid, clever and useful piece of engineering. It basically sums up everything ever about ‘why do we have the audio api again?’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This. That is all. Thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jake_albaugh"&gt;Mr. Albaugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://superlooper.universlabs.co.uk/"&gt;Superlooper&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.universlabs.co.uk/"&gt;Univers Labs&lt;/a&gt; which not only contains beautiful loops but also visuals which are just simple but inspirational. (Very close to my own doodles around A/V so they’ll be more like this I’m sure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a hand with your audio visual creations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/likethemammal"&gt;Chris Dolphin&lt;/a&gt; has created &lt;a href="https://github.com/likethemammal/visualizer-micro"&gt;visualizer-micro.js&lt;/a&gt; a teeny library wrapping just the analysis parts of the audio API, inspired by the methods from that ol’ dancer.js (man that feels like a decade ago right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things that are cool include &lt;a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ab73d19c160c4c509dc6b9decfec3c0f/south-korea-uses-technology-help-pregnant-women-get-seats"&gt;a great use of beacon technology to help pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKRLcQ2Y8kA"&gt;This talk I saw at JS Oxford last month&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashok_menon"&gt;Ashok Menon&lt;/a&gt; literally writing a language &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; a language, or something, it was all like 😳 Very cool tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know others have linked to it, but the tab’s been open so long I couldn’t not include it. This is a &lt;a href="http://a.singlediv.com/"&gt;great showcase of what you can do with just one div and a love affair with CSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re still hot after all that go and buy yourself a cool print, I saw this one and thought it was cool: &lt;a href="http://www.wearedorothy.com/shop/inside-information-minimoog"&gt;The insides of a Minimoog&lt;/a&gt; featuring all your fav artists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week was my last official week at Telefonica (02). I had spent nearly exactly four years in their innovation department. So why move on now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the last year &lt;a href="http://rumyrashead.com/The-Summer-of-15.html"&gt;has been hard&lt;/a&gt; and even with all the treatment &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with all my moving forward I still need a bigger break, a bigger change. Not working full time for a company for a while will help with this. The past few months have been seeing me feel a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; better, however I have some savings and am taking some time for a self imposed sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t just be milling around though, I have speaking engagements booked up all the way until December! Which is amazing and also gives me the chance to do some travelling which has been on my bucket list for an extremely long time, always put on the back burner for career and work. Time to take a bit of a breather from the 9 to 5 take some time for some exploration!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason to move on was the work wasn’t as challenging or web focussed as it had been at the beginning. Web technologies have progressed so much in the past four years and I have been so privileged to have the time to research and play with all the new ones, but the focus of the team had slowly begun to change and this wasn’t the objective anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still mine however, and on top of this realising the course of my own career is important and having some space to do that at this point is needed. It’s been nearly 15 years, this is a long time. Before I got sick I was considering leaving the industry altogether due to a variety of different reasons, (something I shall write about when I have the strength), but this past year reignited my passion and there’s so many things I want to learn and even more things I want to build. I’m hoping this will give me the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be available for consultancy, speaking, writing and dev/design work (although the next few months are already getting busy!). My first project? Well I have two, because working on one thing at a time is sensible: A digital snowflake (more about this later) and my portfolio of course - keep a look out, I started the build today :D&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h3 id="i-know-everything-is-crazy-today"&gt;I know, everything is crazy today!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the UK woke up and thought they were in some parallel evil universe. Europe are feeling a little betrayed/saddened and well, the rest of the world is confused by how they can afford to buy pounds now which is weird for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are my cool links to give you a few minutes of web mindfulness, which now appear at just random intervals, sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly, sometimes monthly. Mostly when cool links happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top of the weird day list is the weird and wonderful (ok stretching it a little here, just wonderful will do) &lt;a href="https://philna.sh/"&gt;Phil Nash&lt;/a&gt; who wrote a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@philnash/the-surprise-multipart-form-data-332846989913#.k0s1bwwv2"&gt;great article on a problem he had using body-parser with the formData object&lt;/a&gt;. Not only because of the subject matter and it makes a good read, but really because he openly and honestly &lt;em&gt;shared a problem he had&lt;/em&gt; which I find a lot of us would be nervous in doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all feel a bit imposter syndrome at times and so when we do this problem solving thing that programming ultimately entails, we feel that sense of relief that we fixed it and we're good programmers and not to say anything and that we never had a problem in the first place and we're super cool. It's ok that sometimes we problem solve, or just skim read the docs or whatever. Let's share all the things and pat everyone on the back for it and it'll save loads of time in the future! Cool 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's &lt;a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/progressive-web-app-dev-summit/"&gt;Progressive Web App Summit&lt;/a&gt; happened! I wanted to give you a pick of the talks, but I was pretty much engrossed for the whole first day and I have the second to catch up on. it's cool tho, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jef9IluQw0&amp;amp;list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAWWNR_Q6eLPhsyx6VvYjVb"&gt;all the talks are online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://trntxt.uk/"&gt;the most performant train times website ever that there was&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielthepope"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; has thankfully made it for you. So screechingly fast it loads on 2G no problem. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSYIR5R3kAY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;a"&gt;Here he is giving a show and tell at JS Oxford&lt;/a&gt; about building it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enough-already-wheres-the-moosique"&gt;Enough already, where's the moosique??&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay! Do you use Atom editor? I don't, I tried it a while back and didn't find it as performant as Sublime. However &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPUw_wJyOTA"&gt;there is this package that generates a synth tone every time you hit a key&lt;/a&gt;. I might install Atom, for like 5 minutes until it gets annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do with 180 custom circuit boards, 540 addressable LEDs and 150W of power. Well I don't need to say anymore, you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2KwD5Is1Z8"&gt;just watch the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOAR SYNTHS. One day the cool links will just be an accumulative list I promise. &lt;a href="http://alexnisnevich.github.io/synthi-js/"&gt;Synthi-js&lt;/a&gt; allows you to upload samples, so that's cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a short and sweet one today, but I may have saved one of the coolest things til last. &lt;a href="http://timpietrusky.com/"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; added some inspiration to &lt;a href="http://webvj.ninja/"&gt;our collective&lt;/a&gt; last week by &lt;a href="http://codepen.io/TimPietrusky/full/jrPRZR/"&gt;creating this little gem&lt;/a&gt;, so simple, complicated and yet so uber cool.&lt;/p&gt;
