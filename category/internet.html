<p>Everyone in the UK woke up and thought they were in some parallel evil universe. Europe are feeling a little betrayed/saddened and well, the rest of the world is confused by how they can afford to buy pounds now which is weird for everyone.</p>

<p>So here are my cool links to give you a few minutes of web mindfulness, which now appear at just random intervals, sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly, sometimes monthly. Mostly when cool links happen.</p>

<p>Top of the weird day list is the weird and wonderful (ok stretching it a little here, just wonderful will do) <a href="https://philna.sh/">Phil Nash</a> who wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@philnash/the-surprise-multipart-form-data-332846989913#.k0s1bwwv2">great article on a problem he had using body-parser with the formData object</a>. Not only because of the subject matter and it makes a good read, but really because he openly and honestly <em>shared a problem he had</em> which I find a lot of us would be nervous in doing.</p>

<p>It's so nice of them - they just tweet me cool sh*tâ€¦ along with the stuff I read or see and go all like 'wo', I think this is becoming a bit of a regular thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LukyVj/family.scss">Luky VJ bought out a sass mixin library</a> to help with all those nth child thing-a-mees - that looks cool.</p>

<p>I could not agree more with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2016/05/24/position-wanted-front-end-director/">this article by Mr. Zeldman</a> about needing a Front End Director, not only for his good points, but from a personal point of view hitting a glass ceiling a while a go and always working under either technical or creative directors, neither of whom specialise in my line of work. This would solve both frustrations in one.</p>

<p>Working with serial devices (like arduinos) and MIDI? Then <a href="http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/">this piece of software should help</a> a nice bridge to help send and receive MIDI.</p>

<p>I attended Google I/O Extended in London last week and only really caught the keynote, so have been catching up a bit this week. There's loads of web stuff, so go take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILe6_eGvDN3GyiodoV3qNSC">look through the listings</a>, progressive web apps are super hot. My personal pick though has to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6Ah68jEX8&amp;index=97&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsILe6_eGvDN3GyiodoV3qNSC">Chris Wilsons What's Next For The Web tho</a>, not only is it all the stuff I try to look at daily, but there's MIDI. It was on about midnight my time, but boy did I know about it, thanks to everyone for the tweets!</p>

<h4 id="typically-heres-some-av">Typically here's some A/V</h4>

<p>It's great to see some more people <a href="https://codepen.io/Rumyra/pen/ojoGwb">piping the audio from a mic into web visuals</a> - here's some <a href="https://the-way-we-move.surge.sh/">really gorgeous canvas ones</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/_dhar">Olivier Audard</a></p>

      <h3 id="this-week-theres-just-cool-links">This week there's just cool links!</h3>

<p>People have shared with me a number of cool things this week, along side the other cool things I've seen, I thought that's all we really needed this week!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-threads-can-change-the-colour-of-your-clothes-instantly">Colour changing thread with electrical current</a> I think tops the list - I think. Having worked with conductive thread it's not too nice, so I'm guessing there's a long way to go really. But the video <em>does</em> feature crochet, so I was sold from the start.</p>
